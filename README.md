# Inception
The Inception project at 42 School involves setting up a secure, scalable, and functional multi-service infrastructure using Docker. It requires creating and configuring containers to deploy services like WordPress, a database, and a file server, all managed within a virtualized environment that mirrors real-world cloud infrastructures.
